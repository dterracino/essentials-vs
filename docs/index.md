#### Extensions and Updates
This one's about pure convenience for me.
When I'm working on an extension, I find myself needing to open this many times a day. 
And I don't know how many times I **accidentally** end up clicking on *Options* 
instead of *Extensions and Updates*.
Or find myself looking up and down the menu trying to find it in the Tools menu.
